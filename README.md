Inconstant Males code - Allan Crossman 2013

This repository contains 2 programs, for Model 1 and 2 described in our paper.
They can both be compiled with a simple command like:

gcc deterministic_model1.c

or

gcc deterministic_model2.c

And then run from the command line. Documentation of the command-line options is in the code.
